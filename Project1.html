                The primary objective of my first web project was to create 
                a visually appealing and user-friendly portfolio website that 
                effectively showcases my data science projects. Since I previously 
                had no experience in HTML, CSS or JavaScript, I aimed to learn 
                those skills by designing this portfolio keeping an emphasis on 
                responsive layouts, intuitive navigation, and engaging interactivity.

                <!--
                The process of designing my portfolio website was an exciting 
                and iterative journey. Starting with a clear vision of a visually 
                appealing and user-friendly platform, I began by planning the overall 
                structure and content hierarchy. With HTML as the foundation, 
                I built the website's structure and organized the content into 
                logical sections.
              </div>
            </p>
            <div id="container" class="hidden-container">
              <div id="hidden-text">
              <p>  Afterwards, I utilized CSS to add an aesthetic appeal and create 
                an engaging visual experience. I selected matching font- and color 
                palettes, typography, and responsive design principles where I aimed
                 for a consistent interface. The iterative process allowed me to 
                 refine the website's aesthetics and ensure a seamless experience 
                 across various devices.
                Introducing interactivity was the next step, accomplished through 
                JavaScript and CSS. I incorporated animations such as smooth transitions 
                or automated scrolling to enhance user engagement and create a memorable
                 browsing experience. Through rigorous testing I continuously 
                 improved these interactive elements for optimal performance and
                  accessibility. Throughout this journey, I remained committed to 
                  continuous learning and improvement.
                In conclusion, the process of designing my portfolio website was
                 marked by constantly learning new practices of front-end development. 
                 Looking ahead, I am excited to apply the knowledge and experiences 
                 gained from this project to further enhance my proficiency in these
                  domains.
